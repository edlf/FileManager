# OG Xbox Open Source File Manager

On **July 21st, 2002**, the very first homebrew file manager for the original Xbox, **boXplorer**, was released.  
It gave users direct control over their files long before dashboards and other tools came along.  
Unfortunately, the source code was never released, so enhancements and new features couldn’t be added.

This project is an attempt to **pay respect to that legacy** with a new **standalone** and most importantly, **open source** file manager for the original Xbox.

## 🛠️ How to Build / Run

- Build with XDK.  
- Copy the compiled `.xbe` to your Xbox.  
- ⚠️ **Important**: Copy the **Media** folder into the **same directory as the `.xbe`**, otherwise the app will fail to load (fonts won’t be found).  
*(Set Xbox to display in **720p** for correct interface display.)*
